# eSportsTracker

eSportsTracker is a simple web application designed to keep up with recent events in the eSports scence, with content from a variety of current popular games. With the use of the Pandascore API, eSportsTracker can gather loads of information, and you can do it justice by creating a website that'll display just about anything concerning recent esporting events.

## Notes
I do not have the website up as of right now, but if you would like to see some visuals on it, feel free to visit my portfolio! (As of 3/2/21 I do not have my portfolio up, but it will be uploaded soon!)

All of this was done with the help of [Pandascore](https://pandascore.co/). Simply create an account to get a free API key in which to put inside of your env file.
